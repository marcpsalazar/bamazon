Bamazon

Bamazon is an interactive node application utilizing MYSQL and allows customers to view available products and their prices.

Upon launching Bamazon, the user will see a display of all products available and be prompted to choose the "ID", an integer value, which corresponds to the product they wish to purchase.

The user will then be prompted to choose the quantity to purchase, also an integer value.

If the quantity is equal to or less than the amount of products in stock, they will receive a congratulatory message and be asked if they would like to begin the process again.

(for class purposes, the beginning and ending stock amounts of the item are also logged at this time.)

If the user chooses a quantity that is greater than the amount in stock, they will receive a different message and again be prompted to decide if they would like to start again.

To view a demonstration, please see the linked video:
